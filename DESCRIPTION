Description: CNAqc is a package to provide a set of metrics to assess the quality of 
  Copy Number Alteration (CNA) calls. The package provides statistical measures to quantify the concordance 
  between mutation and Copy Number calls, exploiting allelic imbalance in absolute CNA segments and allelic 
  frequencies of somatic mutatnions. Quantitative metrics and plots for data exploration and quality check 
  are available, allowing for an intuitive assessment of the quality of calls. Quantitative measures can 
  also be used to suggest adjustemnts of the current purity estimates to increase the quality of CNA calls.
  Routines to determine Cancer Cell Franctions for each mutation are available as well. CNAqc is part of the
  evoverse, a package that gathers multiple R packages to implement Cancer Evolution analyses.

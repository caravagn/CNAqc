### Requirements

* read counts from somatic mutations (SNVs, indels); 
* allele-specific copy number segments (clonal CNAs);
* tumor purity estimate.

`CNAqc` uses chromosome coordinates for one of the supported references to map mutations to segments. Then, it can elaborate a number of analysis that help quality control the consistency among mutations and CNAs, and re-parametrise callers. 

Example inputs and tool functions are discussed as Articles.

### The model

The following concepts are used to develop `CNAqc` analyses.

The **expected Variant Allele Frequency (VAF)** for mutations present in $m$ copies of the tumour genome, when the tumour sample purity is $\pi$ and segment ploidy is $p$ (i.e., total number of copies of the minor and major allele at the mutation locus) are given by
\[
v = \dfrac{m \pi}{
2 (1 - \pi) + \pi p 
} \, .
\]

This formula gives as an expectation for the allelic frequency of somatic mutations that map to a certain karyotype (e.g., a triploid `2:1` segment, or AAB),

Given VAF, tumour purity and CNAs, **Cancer Cell Fractions (CCF)** values can be computed as

\[
\text{CCF} = 
\dfrac{
v[
(p - 2)\pi + 2
]
}
{
m \pi
}
\]
where $p$ is total segment ploidy (e.g., 3 for a `2:1` state).
